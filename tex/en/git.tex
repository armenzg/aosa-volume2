Currently just contains the basic structure of the chapter as I envision 
it today.

\being{aosasect1}{The Version Control Landscape}

This section will describe the two primary classification dimensions to 
Version Control Systems (VCS) today:

\begin{aosasect1}
  \item Distribution mode: local, client/server, distributed
  \item Storage mode: changeset based vs directed acyclic graph (DAG) based
\end{aosasect1}

Provide examples of difference VCSes and how they fit in to these 
classifications, e.g. Subversion (client/server + changeset), Mercurial 
(distributed + changeset), BitKeeper (client/server + DAG), etc.

\begin{aosasect1}{Gitting Started}

Here I will describe the most rudimentary workflow of installing, configuring 
and cloning a remote Git repository. Then explain on a low-level what happened.

Describe the three main elements of a Git working environment:
\begin{aosaitemize}
  \item Repository (object database): default at #{projectdir}/.git subdirectory
  \item Working area: default at #{projectdir} excluding .git subdirectory
  \item Index: default at #{projectdir}/.git/index file
\end{aosaitemize}

Basic steps:
\begin{aosaitemize}
  \item sudo yum install git-core
  \item git config --global user.name ``Your Name''
  \item git config --global user.email ``user@emaildomain.com''
  \item cat #{HOME}/.gitconfig
  \item git clone remote-repo-url
\end{aosaitemize}

Mention the different protocols that can be used with Git, e.g. ssh, http, 
https, git, file and even rsync. Broadly discuss pros and cons of each.

Protocols notes: 
\begin{aosaitemize}
  \item file:// local repository easiest to setup, useful for only one author 
environment
  \item ssh:// most common for active development and easy to setup team repository
  \item http:// good for open source pull based (consumers) users, can setup with 
WebDAV support for allowing pushes, but more work. Good for working in 
restricted public networks where SSH ports may be blocked.
  \item https:// same as http except encrypts pulls and pushes over the wire.
  \item git:// lightweight protocol useful in an enclosed and trusted local network
  \item rsync:// hardly used.
\end{aosaitemize}
